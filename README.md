# TimestampsVsTemperatures
Interpolation; coldest and hottest temperatures every year; compare different year temperatures


Task Description:
- Read the file &#39;temperatures.csv&#39; which has been downloaded from the German weather
service and contains timestamps and temperatures.
- Convert the time steps of the temperature data to 15-minutes-intervals, using interpolation.
- Find the hottest and coldest temperature values for every year and their time of occurrence.
Store this information in a human-readable file (csv or other text file or graphic).
- Plot the temperatures for the hottest days of each provided year onto the same axis, over
time of day.
- Do the same for the coldest days of each year.
- Perform one more analysis that you find interesting on the same data. (Compare the temperatures different years at the same timestamp. Leap year's February 29th data points are removed.)
